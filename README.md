# devcontainer

Over the years I noticed that I have been throwing away a lot of nice dockerfiles and this repository is deemed to change that.

The Visual Studio Code Remote - Containers extension lets you use a Docker container as a full-featured development environment. It allows you to open any folder inside (or mounted into) a container and take advantage of Visual Studio Code's full feature set. A devcontainer.json file in your project tells VS Code how to access (or create) a development container with a well-defined tool and runtime stack. This container can be used to run an application or to separate tools, libraries, or runtimes needed for working with a codebase.

NOTE:
There is no support for any of this, I will help where I can but this repository is for storage not support.
If you however would like to add your dockerfiles as well then simply publish a pull request and I will make sure to merge them.
